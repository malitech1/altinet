# Altinet Architecture

This repository contains the initial skeleton for the Altinet system. The structure is intended to
serve as a foundation for future development and includes placeholders for core modules and
services.

```

## Components

- **core**: Low level networking primitives that power Altinet.
- **services**: Higher level capabilities such as discovery and messaging built on top of the core.
- **utils**: Shared helpers including cryptographic utilities.
- **tests**: Unit tests that exercise the behavior of the system.

Each module is currently a placeholder and should be expanded as the project grows.
